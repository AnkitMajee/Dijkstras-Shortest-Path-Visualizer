## Overview

This project provides a visualization of Dijkstra's Algorithm, a popular algorithm for finding the shortest path between two nodes in a graph. With this visualization tool, users can interactively explore how Dijkstra's Algorithm works and better understand its principles.

## Features

- Interactive visualization of Dijkstra's Algorithm.
- Customizable graph creation.
- Step-by-step visualization of the algorithm's execution.

## Demo

You can see a live demo of the project [here](https://dijkstras-shortest-path-visualizer.vercel.app/).
